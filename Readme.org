* Introduction
Code to get started with for pVSSH-a.

* User Interface
<You fill this part in!>

* How the Code was Tested
<How do you know the path search works?>
<How do you know the stringstream >> next code works to take apart a line of input?>

* To Clean
Removes all compiled files so that the next compilation will be complete rather than
incremental.
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
make clean
#+END_SRC

* To Compile
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
make
#+END_SRC

* To Test
To keep them simple to read, this project has no tests.

* To Run
Each project, when built, shows the name of the executable as the parameter of the -o commandline argument. So, in TextFileReading, the commandline make uses is
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Werror -g  -o build/readBy ...
#+END_SRC

This tells you that the executable is build in =./build/readBy=. The executable is named in the =Makefile=; the source file containing the =main= function is in =src/main/=.

To run the program, type its path at the commandline
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
build/readBy
#+END_SRC

If it takes commandline parameters, they come after the executable
